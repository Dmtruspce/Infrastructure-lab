The DNS server plays a critical role within Active Directory by enabling:

- Domain controller discovery
- Hostname resolution
- Client authentication
- Group Policy communication
- Domain join functionality

The server was assigned the static IP address `10.0.0.4` to ensure reliable DNS communication throughout the environment.

The DNS role was validated by confirming:
- Successful server status
- Active DNS services
- Proper communication with client systems
- Event logging visibility within Server Manager
